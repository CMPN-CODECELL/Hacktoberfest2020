## Description
The Iris dataset is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species
