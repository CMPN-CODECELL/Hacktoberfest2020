Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Implement different data-preprocessing techniques, feature extraction techniques and machine learning models. 
This is a supervised classification problem.

A few example solutions:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest Classifier

- SVM Classifier

- Decision Tree

- K-Means

- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)

- Neural networks

- Other

## Suggestions/guides:

We will have a model performance comparison table, so it is best to standardise metric/measures as well as some performance measurement practices. 

- Please use train/test split ratio of 80/20. Random seeds could be anything, they should not matter.

- Please provide the full confusion marix and F1 score.

- Feel free to tune and work on as many models as you want offline.
